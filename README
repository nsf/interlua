C++11 â†” Lua bindings generator. Based on the API of LuaBridge
(https://github.com/vinniefalco/LuaBridge).

It's still in development, the core is written, but there are a couple of
things I'm still working on:
 - Tests coverage is less than desirable.
 - Documentation is missing.

Hopefully it will be complete in month or two. If you read this, then it's not
ready yet. This message will be removed as soon as I'm done with it.
